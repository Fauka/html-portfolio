<h3>Slam Dunk</h3>

<p>
  One of my favourite animated movies, the use of CGI mixed with animation is
  just outstanding
</p>

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>

<p>The story just had me from the beginning. The action was also top Tier</p>

<h3>Life Aquatica</h3>

<p>
  Just love how the way it was filmed, mixture of comedy with drama just pulls
  me in.
